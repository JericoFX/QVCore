QVCore isnt a joke lol, i want to try to port QBCore over to Alt:V, and in the middle learn some new stuff in JS. Still dont know how to achive the core, if in a modular way Core => Modules => Core,  Core => Modules => Multiplayer or a traditional way each resource in a different folder.

* IS this gonna be released?
	I dont Know....

* Why this is code in a bad way.
	I dont know... im learning
	
* Why QBCore?
	I get use to it, ESX is an awesome framework too but i dont remember how to work with it. (i know that QBCore is ESX)
