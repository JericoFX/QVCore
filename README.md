# QVCore

QVCore is a personal project, im trying to conver QBCore to Alt:V.
I want to learn a lot of javascript and this (at least for me) is the best way to do it.
Esx is another excelent framework but i already get use to QBCore - QBox.


Again, im learning so do not use this as a main Core.



## Usage/Examples

```typescript
player.citizenid << Getter
return string
